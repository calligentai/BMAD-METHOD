# Project Simulation

This project follows the BMAD method structure.

## Structure
- `core/`: Main simulation logic and algorithms
- `common/`: Shared utilities and components
- `docs/`: Documentation and workflow
- `expansion-packs/`: Optional modules and extensions
- `tools/`: Scripts and helper tools

## BMAD Workflow
1. **Build**: Develop core simulation modules
2. **Measure**: Integrate data collection and analysis
3. **Analyze**: Implement analytics and reporting
4. **Decide**: Support decision-making with results

Refer to the `docs/` folder for detailed methodology and usage.
