# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> This PRD defines the simulation project's purpose, users, scope, and functional/non-functional requirements. Use BMAD agents (@PRD, @PM, @Architect) to refine and shard.

## 1. Vision
Provide a flexible simulation platform to model domain scenarios, collect metrics, and drive data-informed decisions.

## 2. Stakeholders
| Role | Interest | Responsibilities |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Product Owner | Strategic fit | Prioritize features |
| Simulation Engineer | Accuracy & performance | Implement engine |
| Analyst | Actionable insights | Define metrics & dashboards |
| DevOps | Reliability | Environments & automation |

## 3. Problem Statement
Current experimentation is ad-hoc, slow to reproduce, and lacks structured measurement.

## 4. Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)
| Objective | Key Result |
|-----------|------------|
| Reduce iteration time | < 5 min average cycle |
| Improve model fidelity | Validation error < 3% |
| Increase insight velocity | 90% of experiments auto-reported |

## 5. In Scope
- Core simulation loop
- Configurable scenario parameters
- Metrics pipeline
- Basic reporting artifacts

## 6. Out of Scope (Initial)
- Distributed cluster execution
- Real-time streaming UI
- External billing integration

## 7. User Stories (Initial Backlog)
| ID | As a | I want | So that |
|----|------|--------|---------|
| US-001 | Engineer | Run a simulation with a config file | I can reproduce results |
| US-002 | Analyst | Export metrics to CSV | I can explore in tools |
| US-003 | Product Owner | View KPI summary | I can assess progress |

## 8. Functional Requirements
| ID | Description | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-001 | CLI command to execute a simulation scenario | High |
| FR-002 | Config loader supporting YAML/JSON | High |
| FR-003 | Metrics collector writes structured logs | High |
| FR-004 | Persist run metadata (timestamp, seed) | Medium |
| FR-005 | Basic dashboard generation script | Medium |

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
| Category | Requirement |
|----------|------------|
| Performance | Single run completes < 60s for baseline scenario |
| Reproducibility | Deterministic runs given seed |
| Observability | Metrics + structured logs stored per run |
| Extensibility | Pluggable metrics modules |

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | Delay core delivery | Freeze MVP feature list |
| Over-engineering | Slow iteration | Favor incremental layering |
| Poor metrics design | Weak insights | Collaborate w/ analyst early |

## 11. Open Questions
- Which persistence backend after local phase? (SQLite? Qdrant? Postgres?)
- Is GPU acceleration needed for any heavy computation?

## 12. Sharding Plan
PRD will be sharded into section files under `docs/prd/sections/` once content grows:
- `vision.md`
- `requirements-functional.md`
- `requirements-nonfunctional.md`
- `user-stories.md`
- `architecture-touchpoints.md`
